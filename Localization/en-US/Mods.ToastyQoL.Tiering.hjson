# short names for existing bosses.
# some full names are not suitable in the progression tooltip. Like, we don't say "This is post The Destroyer", it should be just "Destroyer"
# The situation may vary in different languages. If new short names in other languages are added here and used in Core\Systems\TieringSystem.cs, please keep the existing full names in other languages.
# e.g., you make a short name for the Twins in your language, you may write "TwinsShort: BlahBlah" in your language, and you should also write "TwinsShort: "{$Enemies.TheTwins}"" in other languages.
